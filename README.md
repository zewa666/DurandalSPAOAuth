# Durandal SPA OAuth StarterKit

This is a sample mockup of the [Durandal Starter Kit](https://github.com/BlueSpire/Durandal/tree/master/platforms/Microsoft.NET/Nuget/Durandal.StarterKit/content)
used together with a simple OAuth Implementation.

The focus of this example is to leverage the DotNetOpenAuth without any .NET MembershipProviders.
Additionally the sample shows how to login via OAuth without having to leave the SPA or reload it (done via Javascript Popup).

This demo was inspired by following articles:

* [Using OAuthWebSecurity without SimpleMembership](http://brockallen.com/2012/09/04/using-oauthwebsecurity-without-simplemembership/)
* [Signing in without refreshing or leaving the page](http://openid-demo.appspot.com/)
